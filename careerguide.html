<h3>📌 2. Skills You Need to Learn AI</h3>

To become an AI expert, you need to learn some skills. 
Don’t worry! You don’t need to learn everything at once. Take it step by step.

🔢 A. Mathematics (Basic to Intermediate)

✅ Algebra (Solving equations)
✅ Probability & Statistics (Understanding data)
✅ Linear Algebra (For deep learning)

> Tip: You can start with basic math and improve as you go.
 Websites like Khan Academy or YouTube are great for learning math.

<h3>💻 B. Programming (Coding) </h3>

AI needs coding! The most popular language for AI is Python 🐍.
✅ Python is easy to learn and beginner-friendly.
✅ Learn basic Python first: Loops, conditions, and functions.
✅ Then, explore AI libraries: NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, PyTorch.

> Tip: Try free coding platforms like Google Colab, Kaggle, or Jupyter Notebook.
